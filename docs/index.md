# Abstract

This project aims to develop a laser pointer tracking system for mouse cursor control on projection screens using a Raspberry Pi and an ESP32. It adapts real-time computer vision algorithms for efficient spot detection and cursor positioning on embedded systems to make a low-cost, intuitive interface that enhances interaction with digital content.
